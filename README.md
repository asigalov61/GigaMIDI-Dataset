## The extended GigaMIDI Dataset Summary 
We present the extended GigaMIDI dataset, a large-scale symbolic music collection comprising over 2.1 million unique MIDI files with detailed annotations for music loop detection. Expanding on its predecessor, this release introduces a novel expressive loop detection method that captures performance nuances such as microtiming and dynamic variation, essential for advanced generative music modelling. Our method extends previous approaches, which were limited to strictly quantized, non-expressive tracks, by employing the Note Onset Median Metric Level (NOMML) heuristic to distinguish expressive from non-expressive material. This enables robust loop detection across a broader spectrum of MIDI data. Our loop detection method reveals more than 9.2 million non-expressive loops spanning all General MIDI instruments, alongside 2.3 million expressive loops identified through our new method. As the largest resource of its kind, the extended GigaMIDI dataset provides a strong foundation for developing models that synthesize structurally coherent and expressively rich musical loops. As a use case, we leverage this dataset to train an expressive multitrack symbolic music loop generation model using the MIDI-GPT system, resulting in the creation of a synthetic loop dataset.

## Running MIDI-based Loop Detection

Included with GigaMIDI dataset is a collection of all loops identified in the 
dataset between 4 and 32 bars in length, with a minimum density of 0.5 notes 
per beat. For our purposes, we consider a segment of a track to be loopable if 
it is bookended by a repeated phrase of a minimum length (at least 2 beats 
and 4 note events)

![Loop example](./loops_nomml/loop_ex_labeled.png)

### Starter Code

To run loop detection on a single MIDI file, use the `detect_loops` function
```python
from loops_nomml import detect_loops
from symusic import Score

score = Score("tests\midi_files\Mr. Blue Sky.mid")
loops = detect_loops(score)
print(loops)
```

The output will contain all the metadata needed to locate the loop within the 
file. Start and end times are represented as MIDI ticks, and density is 
given in units of notes per beat:
```
{'track_idx': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5], 'instrument_type': ['Piano', 'Piano', 'Piano', 'Piano', 'Piano', 'Piano', 'Piano', 'Piano', 'Piano', 'Drums', 'Drums', 'Drums', 'Drums', 'Drums', 'Piano', 'Piano'], 'start': [238080, 67200, 165120, 172800, 1920, 97920, 15360, 216960, 276480, 7680, 195840, 122880, 284160, 117120, 49920, 65280], 'end': [241920, 82560, 180480, 188160, 3840, 99840, 17280, 220800, 291840, 9600, 211200, 138240, 291840, 130560, 51840, 80640], 'duration_beats': [8.0, 32.0, 32.0, 32.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 8.0, 32.0, 4.0, 32.0, 32.0, 16.0, 28.0, 4.0, 32.0], 'note_density': [0.75, 1.84375, 0.8125, 0.8125, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.8125, 2.46875, 2.4375, 2.5, 0.5, 0.6875]}  
```

### Batch Processing Loops

We also provide a script, `main.py` that batch extracts all loops in a 
dataset. This requires that you have downloaded GigaMIDI, see the [dataset README](./GigaMIDI/README.md) for instructions on doing this. Once you have the dataset downloaded, update the `DATA_PATH` and `METADATA_NAME` globals to reflect the location of GigaMIDI on your machine and run the script:

```python
python main.py
```


## Instruction for using the code for note onset median metric level (NOMML) heuristic
### Install and import Python libraries for the NOMML code: <br /> 
Imported libraries: 
```
pip install numpy tqdm symusic
```
<br />
Note: symusic library is used for MIDI parsing.

### Using with the command line  <br />
usage: 
```python
python nomml.py [-h] --folder FOLDER [--force] [--nthreads NTHREADS]
```
<br />
Note: If you run the code succesfully, it will generate .JSON file with appropriate metadata.

The metadata median metric depth corresponds to the Note Onset Median Metric Level (NOMML). 
Please refer to the latest information below, as this repository was intended to be temporary during the anonymous peer-review process 
of the academic paper. Based on our experiments, tracks at levels 0-11 can be classified as non-expressive, while level 12 indicates 
expressive MIDI tracks. Note that this classification applies at the track level, not the file level.

## Pipeline Configuration

The following pipeline configuration was determined through hyperparameter tuning using leave-one-out cross-validation and GridSearchCV for the logistic regression model:

```python
# Hyperparameters
{'C': 0.046415888336127774}

# Logistic Regression Instance
LogisticRegression(random_state=0, C=0.046415888336127774, max_iter=10000, tol=0.1)

# Pipeline
Pipeline(steps=[('scaler', StandardScaler(with_std=False)),
                ('logistic',
                 LogisticRegression(C=0.046415888336127774, max_iter=10000,
                                    tol=0.1))])
```

# Expressive Loop Detection Pipeline

This repository contains a highly parallelized Python pipeline for detecting both **non-expressive** (hard-match) and **expressive** (soft-count) loops in large MIDI datasets. Built on the GigaMIDI `loops_nomml` library and Symusic for MIDI parsing, it uses `joblib` to distribute work across all available CPU cores. The workflow periodically writes out **checkpoint** CSVs (every 500 000 files) and produces a final, aggregated result. The code is available in the file named Expressive music loop detector-NOMML12.ipynb.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hard-match detection**  
  Finds exact, bar-aligned pitch-set repeats.  
- **Soft-count detection**  
  Captures expressive loops by combining pitch overlap, velocity similarity, and micro-timing tolerance.  
- **Loopability scoring**  
  A single metric blending the length of the longest repeat with overall repetition density.  
- **Scalable batch processing**  
  Checkpoints output every 500 000 files (`loops_checkpoint_1.csv`, `loops_checkpoint_2.csv`, …).  
- **Full parallelization**  
  Leverages `joblib.Parallel` to utilize all CPU cores for maximum throughput.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Symusic** for MIDI I/O  
- **GigaMIDI `loops_nomml`** module (place alongside this repo)  
- Install required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas joblib tqdm


---

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repo alongside your local `loops_nomml` checkout:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUser/expressive-loop-detect.git
   cd expressive-loop-detect
   ```
2. (Optional) Create & activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

1. **Prepare your CSV**
   Place your input CSV (default name:
   `Final_GigaMIDI_Loop_V2_path-instrument-NOMML-type.csv`) in the working directory. It must have:

   | Column      | Description                                                       |
   | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `file_path` | Path to each `.mid` or `.midi` file                               |
   | `NOMML`     | Python list of per-track expressiveness flags (e.g. `[12,2,4,…]`) |

2. **Configure parameters**
   At the top of `detect_loops.py`, you can adjust:

   * `melodic_tau`  (default `0.3`): similarity threshold for melodic tracks
   * `drum_tau`     (default `0.1`): threshold for drum tracks
   * `chunk_size`   (default `500_000`): number of files per checkpoint
   * Bars are quantized every 4 beats; min/max loop lengths and density filters live in the `get_valid_loops` call.

3. **Run the detector**

   ```bash
   python detect_loops.py
   ```

   Or open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook detect_loops.ipynb
   ```

   The script will:

   * Read the CSV of file paths
   * Process MIDI files in parallel, chunk by chunk
   * Save checkpoint CSVs named `loops_checkpoint_1.csv`, `loops_checkpoint_2.csv`, …
   * After all chunks, combine results into one DataFrame and save `loops_full_output.csv`

---

## 📊 Output

* **Checkpoint CSVs** (`loops_checkpoint_<n>.csv`): one row per MIDI file in that chunk, with columns:

  * `file_path`
  * `track_idx` (list of track indices with detected loops)
  * `MIDI program number` (list)
  * `instrument_group` (list of GM groups or “Drums”)
  * `loopability` (list of floats)
  * `start_tick`, `end_tick` (lists of integers)
  * `duration_beats` (list of floats)
  * `note_density` (list of floats)

* **Full output** (`loops_full_output.csv`): concatenation of all checkpoint rows.

**Example to load with correct list parsing**:

```python
import pandas as pd

converters = { 
  'track_idx': eval,
  'MIDI program number': eval,
  'instrument_group': eval,
  'loopability': eval,
  'start_tick': eval,
  'end_tick': eval,
  'duration_beats': eval,
  'note_density': eval
}

df = pd.read_csv("loops_full_output.csv", converters=converters)
```
| Column                   | Type           | Description                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `file_path`              | string         | Original MIDI filepath                      |
| `track_idx`              | list of ints   | Indices of tracks where loops were detected |
| `MIDI program number`    | list of ints   | Corresponding MIDI program codes            |
| `instrument_group`       | list of strs   | GM group (or “Drums”) for each loop         |
| `loopability`            | list of floats | Loopability score per detected loop         |
| `start_tick`, `end_tick` | list of ints   | Loop boundaries (MIDI ticks)                |
| `duration_beats`         | list of floats | Loop lengths in beats                       |
| `note_density`           | list of floats | Active-notes-per-beat density per loop      |

---

## 📝 Troubleshooting

* **No loops found**: try lowering `melodic_tau` or relaxing `min_rep_beats`/`min_beats`.
* **`IndexError` in beat-duration**: the script patches `get_duration_beats` for safety.
* **Performance issues**: set `n_jobs` in `Parallel(...)` to fewer cores or reduce `chunk_size`.
